SpecFlow Automation Testing

This repository contains an automation testing framework for web applications using 
**SpecFlow**, **Selenium WebDriver**, and **C#**. SpecFlow is a popular framework for 
behavior-driven development (BDD), allowing you to write tests in natural language (Gherkin) 
and execute them with C# code.

Prerequisites

To run the tests in this repository, you'll need to have the following tools installed on your system:

- **.NET SDK** (for building and running the tests)
- **Visual Studio** or **Visual Studio Code** (for editing and running tests)
- **Selenium WebDriver** (for web automation)
- **SpecFlow** (for BDD testing)
- **ChromeDriver** (or other browser drivers for Selenium)

Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
```

### 2. Install NuGet Packages
In your Visual Studio project, open the **NuGet Package Manager** and install the following packages:

- **SpecFlow**
- **SpecFlow.NUnit** (or another test framework like MSTest or xUnit)
- **Selenium.WebDriver**
- **Selenium.Chrome.WebDriver** (or other browser drivers based on your browser)

You can install these packages using the **Package Manager Console**:

```bash
Install-Package SpecFlow
Install-Package SpecFlow.NUnit
Install-Package Selenium.WebDriver
Install-Package Selenium.Chrome.WebDriver
```

### 3. Set Up WebDriver
Make sure you have the appropriate **ChromeDriver** (or the driver for your browser) installed and that it matches the version of your browser. You can download **ChromeDriver** from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/).

Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
/SpecFlowSelenium
|-- /Features                   # Gherkin feature files
|-- /StepDefinitions            # C# code for step definitions
|-- /Pages                      # Page Object Model classes for encapsulating interactions
|-- /Hooks                      # Before and After hooks for managing WebDriver
|-- /Utilities                  # Utility classes (e.g., WebDriverManager)
|-- /bin                        # Compiled binaries (auto-generated)
|-- /obj                        # Intermediate build files
```

### Key Components

- **Feature Files**: Located in the `/Features` directory, these files describe the behavior of the application in Gherkin syntax.
- **Step Definitions**: Located in the `/StepDefinitions` directory, these files contain the C# code that corresponds to the steps written in the feature files.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: The `/Pages` directory contains the Page Object Model classes that represent the web pages in the application under test.
- **Hooks**: Located in the `/Hooks` directory, these files define actions that should be performed before or after each scenario, such as initializing and disposing of the WebDriver.

Running Tests

To run the tests, you can use **Visual Studio Test Explorer** or the **dotnet CLI**.

### Using Visual Studio
1. Open the project in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution.
3. Open the **Test Explorer** and run the tests.

### Using dotnet CLI
To run the tests via the command line, navigate to the project folder and use the following command:

```bash
dotnet test
```

This will build and run all the tests in the project.

Writing Tests

SpecFlow tests are written in **Gherkin** syntax. Here's an example feature file:

```gherkin
Feature: Login functionality

  Scenario: Valid user can log in
    Given I open the login page
    When I enter a valid username and password
    Then I should see the dashboard
```

For each scenario in the feature file, you'll need to create corresponding step definitions in C#.

Example Step Definitions

Hereâ€™s an example of step definitions in C#:

```csharp
[Binding]
public class LoginSteps
{
    private readonly IWebDriver _driver;

    public LoginSteps(IWebDriver driver)
    {
        _driver = driver;
    }

    [Given(@"I open the login page")]
    public void GivenIOpenTheLoginPage()
    {
        _driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("https://example.com/login");
    }

    [When(@"I enter a valid username and password")]
    public void WhenIEnterAValidUsernameAndPassword()
    {
        _driver.FindElement(By.Id("username")).SendKeys("validUser");
        _driver.FindElement(By.Id("password")).SendKeys("validPassword");
        _driver.FindElement(By.Id("loginButton")).Click();
    }

    [Then(@"I should see the dashboard")]
    public void ThenIShouldSeeTheDashboard()
    {
        Assert.True(_driver.FindElement(By.Id("dashboard")).Displayed);
    }
}
```
